109728,02/04/2020,Lockdown should be given highest priority at this time because that's the only option we have to stop corona virus spread. #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
109729,02/04/2020,With the rapid spread of the virus  Lockdown is urgent to bring down overall transmission and see whether testing followed by isolation could be effective. That's why #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
109730,02/04/2020,Lockdown will save us from the threat of the virus spreading further. My request to all #SupportLockdownStaySafe .,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
109731,02/04/2020,As there is No treatment  No Vaccine available for Covid-19  prevention/ Lockdown is the only solution to break the chain of transmission from human to human via droplets while coughing n sneezing from a patient. #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
109732,02/04/2020,Lockdown doesn't just mean stopping work or going to office. And then U R allowed to go out  if ppl go out  they can contact many other ppl n then d transmission of corona virus will increase. A single infected man can infect thousands of men. Hence #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
109733,02/04/2020,Doctors  media staff  police  our armed forces are working under high risk to ensure Lockdown is being followed. Support them by staying at home. #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli

109735,02/04/2020,Lockdown has curbed Coronavirus infection to a great extent. Cases in India are not increasing as rapidly as in other countries . Hence #SupportLockdownStaySafe,Dadra and Nagar Haveli
