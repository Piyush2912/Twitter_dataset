121551,05/04/2020,60% of all COVID19 positive cases are linked to Tablighi Jamat. But isn't this because they have been tested  whereas the overall testing is very little. Test more  and you will realise the real picture is very different. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
121552,05/04/2020,The PM thinks of the people as sheep  who can be herded in any direction. The docs are facing a shortage of safety gear.

121553,05/04/2020,With the kind of density of population in India  specially in pockets where poor reside  there is an urgent need for mass testing. The Dharavi casualty due to #COVID19 should be an eye opener. #TestKaroNa,Bihar

121556,05/04/2020,Most of our media is not interested in raising substantive questions regarding our response to COVID19.

121557,05/04/2020,Rather than acting as Modi's personal PR firm for his antics  is it not the responsibility of our TV news channels to ask the govt why are there so few tests for #COVID19? #TestKaroNa,Bihar
121558,05/04/2020,Maharashtra and Kerala have recorded the most number of people tested positive for #COVID19. Is it a coincidence that these are also the states which have had the highest number of tests? We will never know the real picture unless we test enough people. #TestKaroNa,Bihar

126019,05/04/2020,We are incurring huge economic losses because of the lockdown and a huge part of population is being rendered destitute. Still the Lockdown is NECESSARY to control the spread of COVID-19. But if we don't increase testing too  the Lockdown will be useless. TEST MORE!! #TestKaroNa,Bihar
126020,05/04/2020,Countries like South Korea  Singapore &China have flattened the curve with mass testing as a major strategy together with tracing  isolation  quarantining and lockdowns. If India doesn't increase tests then this lockdown will be useless. #TestsKaroNa,Bihar

126024,05/04/2020,Lockdown was announced with only a four hour notice and complete lack of planning. It left the poor stranded on the road. Despite all the hardships  this lockdown will be a total failure if we don't test enough people? #TestKaroNa,Bihar

153644,11/04/2020,NaMo's legacy in public health as Gujarat CM Gujarat spent 4.39% of state expend on health in 1999. By 2009 this came down to 0.77%. Result: Lack of hospital beds  ventillators & ICUs. Consequence: Highest fatality rate in COVID19. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
153645,11/04/2020,Gujarat has seen the highest fatality rate amongst COVID19 affected patients (7.88% as opposed to 2.87% for India as a whole). The public health system of Gujarat which is lying in shambles is one of the main reasons behind this. Please #PehleHealthCare,Bihar

207058,21/04/2020,The threat the coronavirus brings to this colony is not just that of death or infection or illness â those already exist â but also a heightened hunger and lack of access to medical help in the wake of a complete lockdown. #IndiaStarving,Bihar
