163695,12/04/2020,Lockdown extension will be only effective when its been followed 100% rigorously else our whole effort will go in vain. Law breaking offenders should be dealt very strictly in this extension phase. Economic revival plan by all states should also be done parallely. Regards,Goa
163696,12/04/2020,Then why the lock down? Let migrant workers go about their jobs  daily wagers should earntheir living. India has not arrived at the stage where these people could stay at home and get their wages. The emperor made many announcements but they are just that. ,Goa
